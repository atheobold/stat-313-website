> Independence is about **observations** and relationships between observations.

## Independence Within Groups

-   What are the groups in your analysis?
-   Are the observations *within* those groups related?
    -   Is an observation included multiple times within a group?
    -   Are there relationships (e.g., biological, spatial, temporal) between the observations?

## Independence Between Groups

-   What are the groups in your analysis?
-   Are the observations *between* those groups related?
    -   Can an observation appear in more than one group?
