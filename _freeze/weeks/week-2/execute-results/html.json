We will be using the **dplyr** package in `R` to wrangle our data and the **ggplot2** package to created data visualizations.\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this coursework you should be able to:\n\n-   outline the differences between numerical and categorical variables\n-   describe what type of summary statistic is appropriate for a given distribution of a numerical variable\n-   discuss when it is / is not appropriate to summarize a variable with a mean\n-   create visualizations of one and two numerical variables\n-   discuss the benefits and shortcomings of different visualizations\n\n# Prepare\n\n## Textbook Reading -- Part 1\n\n::: column-margin\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/ims.jpeg){width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n[**Required Reading:** Exploring Numerical Data](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/explore-numerical.html)\n\n### Reading Guide -- Due Thursday by the Beginning of Class\n\n[Download the Word Document](reading-guide/week2-reading2.docx)\n\n::: callout-note\n# Submission\n\nSubmit your completed reading guide to the Canvas assignment portal!\n:::\n\n## Concept Quiz\n\n::: callout-note\nThe two concept quizzes from each chapter have been combined into **one** concept quiz on Canvas.\n:::\n\n1.  Suppose we have data on the departure delays of flights flying out of New York. What shape would you expect the distribution of departure delays to have?\n\n-   right skew\n-   left skew\n-   bimodal\n-   mutimodal\n-   uniform\n\n*Hint:* Think about how you would \"typically\" expect flight delays to behave.\n\n2.  To better decide what summary statistic we should use to summarize the departure delays it would be best to create a data visualization of the *distribution* of departure delays. What type of visualizations could we make? Select all that apply!\n\n-   boxplot\n-   histogram\n-   barplot\n-   density plot\n-   scatterplot\n\n## Textbook Reading -- Part 2\n\n[**Required Reading:** Data Visualization](https://moderndive.com/2-viz.html)\n\n::: column-margin\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/modern_dive.png){width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Reading Guide -- Due Thursday by the Beginning of Class\n\n[Download the Word Document](reading-guide/week2-reading1.docx)\n\n::: callout-note\n# Submission\n\nSubmit your completed reading guide to the Canvas assignment portal!\n:::\n\n## Concept Quiz -- Due Thursday by the Beginning of Class\n\n::: callout-note\nThe two concept quizzes from each chapter have been combined into **one** concept quiz on Canvas.\n:::\n\n1.

What **geometric objects** are being used in the displayed visualization?\n\n*Hint: Think about what `geom`s you would use to make this plot!*\n\n-   points\n-   lines / smoothers\n-   colors\n-   facets\n\n3.  What aspects of the distribution of departure delays can you see in the histogram that you could not see in the boxplot?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](week-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](week-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   shape of distribution\n-   median\n-   outliers\n-   mode\n\n# R Tutorial -- Due Thursday by the Beginning of Class\n\n💻 [**Required Tutorial:** Exploring Numerical Data](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-02-explore-02/)\n\n💻 [**Required Tutorial:** Summarizing with Statistics](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-02-explore-03/)\n\n::: callout-note\n# Submission\n\nSubmit a screenshot of the completion page for each tutorial to the Canvas assignment portal!\n:::\n",
