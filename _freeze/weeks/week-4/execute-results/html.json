We will start with the \"basic\" case or simple linear regression, with a single quantitative explanatory variable and a quantitative response. We will review the concepts behind linear regression, learn how to visualize regression models, and practice obtaining the estimated regression lines in `R`.\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this coursework you should be able to:\n\n-   describe the difference between explanatory and predictive modeling\n-   produce data visualizations for a simple linear regression\n-   describe how `R` decides on the \"best\" regression line\n-   fit a simple linear regression in `R`\n-   write out an estimated regression line\n-   interpret the slope of an estimated regression line\n-   interpret the intercept of an estimated regression line\n-   describe what an \"offset\" is in a simple linear regression\n-   interpret the offsets of an estimated regression line\n-   calculate a residual for an observation\n\n# Prepare\n\n## Textbook Reading\n\n[Chapter 5 (https://moderndive.com/5-regression.html)](https://moderndive.com/5-regression.html)\n\n::: column-margin\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/modern_dive.png){width=795}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-caution\nDon't worry about Section 5.3.3, it goes a bit too in the weeds for what we are interested in.\n:::\n\n### Reading Guide\n\n[Download the Word Document](reading-guide/week4-reading.docx)\n\n::: callout-tip\n# Different colored answers\n\nPlease use a different color for your answers to the reading guide, so it is easier to find your responses! 😊\n:::\n\n## Concept Quiz -- Due Monday by the start of class\n\n**1. What does the correlation coefficient measure?**\n\n-   strength of a relationship between two variables\n-   strength of a linear relationship between two variables\n-   strength of a relationship between two numerical variables\n-   strength of a linear relationship between two numerical variables\n\n**2. How do you interpret a slope coefficient?**\n\n-   For any increase of $x$, the slope is the expected increase in $y$\n-   For any increase of $x$, the slope is the expected increase in the mean of $y$\n-   For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the slope is the expected increase in $y$\n-   For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the slope is the expected increase in the mean of $y$\n\n**3. How do you interpret an intercept coefficient?**\n\n-   For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the intercept is the expected increase in $y$\n-   For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the intercept is the expected increase in the mean of $y$\n-   For an $x$ value of 0, the intercept is the expected value of $y$\n-   For an $x$ value of 0, the intercept is the expected value of the mean of $y$\n\n**4. Match the *explanatory* and *response* variables to the correct variables in the `lm()` function syntax.**\n\n`lm(variable1 ~ variable2, data = <NAME OF DATASET>)`\n\n**5. What `geom_` adds a linear regression line to a scatterplot?**\n\n-   `geom_line()`\n-   `geom_smoother()`\n-   `geom_regression()`\n-   `geom_smooth()`\n\n## 💻 R Tutorial -- Due Wednesday by the start of class\n\n1.
