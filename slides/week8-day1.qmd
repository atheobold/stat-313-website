- Knowing a statistic's behavior helps us make better / more informed decisions!

## Generating a permuted resample and calculating permuted statistics

</br>

. . .

**Step 1:** `specify()` your response and explanatory variables

. . .

**Step 2:** `hypothesize()` what would happen under the null

. . .

**Step 3:** `generate()` permuted resamples

. . .

**Step 4:** `calculate()` the statistic of interest

## Step 1: Specify your variables!

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: specify
#| echo: true

hbr_maples %>% 
  specify(response = stem_dry_mass,
          explanatory = stem_length)
```

## Step 2: State your hypothesis!

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: hypothesize
#| echo: true

hbr_maples %>% 
  specify(response = stem_dry_mass,
          explanatory = stem_length) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence")
```

</br>

`"independence"` -- the assumed relationship between the explanatory and response variables under the null hypothesis

. . .

::: callout-tip
# Independence of variables

Note! This is different from assuming your observations are independent!
:::

## Step 3: Generate your resamples!

```{r generate}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

hbr_maples %>% 
  specify(response = stem_dry_mass,
          explanatory = stem_length) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute")
```

. . .

</br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
`reps` -- the number of resamples you want to generate
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
`"permute"` -- the method that should be used to generate the new samples
:::
:::

## Don't worry,

`infer` will let you know if you missed something!

```{r permute-error}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
hbr_maples %>% 
  specify(response = stem_dry_mass,
          explanatory = stem_length) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute")
```

</br>

```         
Error: Permuting should be done only when doing independence hypothesis test. See `hypothesize()`.
In addition: Warning message:
You have given `type = "permute"`, but `type` is expected to be `"bootstrap"`.
This workflow is untested and the results may not mean what you think they mean. 
```

## Step 4: Calculate your statistics!

```{r calculate}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

hbr_maples %>% 
  specify(response = stem_dry_mass,
          explanatory = stem_length) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "slope") 
```

##  Your turn!

Why is the `hypothesize()` function used to make a null distribution but not for a bootstrap distribution?

</br>

What does the `null = "independence"` input in `hypothesize()` mean? What is it assuming about the variables declared in the `specify()` step?

## The final product


```{r null-dist}
#| out-width: 70%
#| echo: true
visualise(null_dist) + 
  labs(x = "Permuted Slope Statistic")
```

## Is our observed statistic unlikely if the null hypothesis was true?

```{r}
#| label: obs-slope

obs_slope <- hbr_maples %>% 
  specify(response = stem_dry_mass,
          explanatory = stem_length) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "slope") 
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: null-dist-with-obs-slope

visualise(null_dist) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_slope, 
                direction = "two-sided") +
  labs(x = "Permuted Slope Statistic")
```

##  The p-value is...

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: p-value
#| message: true
#| warning: true
get_p_value(null_dist, 
            obs_stat = obs_slope, 
            direction = "two-sided") 
```

. . .

</br>

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #ed8402;"}
Why did we get a warning?
:::

## How do we interpret a p-value?

. . .

Need:

-   probability of what we saw in the data
-   assuming the null hypothesis is true

. . .

> The probability of observing a slope statistic (for the relationship between stem length and stem dry mass) as or more extreme than what was observed is less than 1 in 1000, if there was no relationship between a sugar maple's stem length and stem dry mass.

## Classic interpretation mistakes

</br>

> "The probability that the null hypothesis is true is about 0%."

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 1.25em; color: #ed8402;"}
You assume the null is true when you calculate a p-value!
