- In Statistics, Galton (1822–1911) is a towering figure.

  * He invented standard deviation, correlation, linear regression, ANOVA
  
- Galton's developments and discoveries were fueled in large part by his fascination with the science of heredity.
]

<!-- Galton was wrestling with the unanswered question of how different traits stayed stable in a population over generations, building on the work of his cousin Charles Darwin, who had published On the Origin of Species in 1859. -->

- In 1896 Connecticut made it illegal for people with epilepsy or who were
"feeble-minded" to marry. 

--

- John Kellogg established a "pedigree registry" 

--

- From 1909 to 1979 California sterilized nearly 20,000 residents of the state 
mental institutions

--

- In 1927 the US Supreme Court ruled that sterilization of the handicapped did 
not violate the Constitution --- "...three generations of imbeciles are enough." 

--

- Between 1970 and 1976 between 25 and 50% of Native Americans were sterilized, 
many without consent
