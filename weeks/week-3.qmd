Welcome!

In this week's coursework we are going to dive deeper into exploring data, by incorporating categorical variables. Specifically, we will explore how we can incorporate categorical variables into our visualizations through the use of colors and facets. We will also explore how we can obtain summary statistics for different groups of a categorical variable, making our summaries more specific.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this coursework you should be able to:

-   describe what a categorical variable is and how these types of variables are stored in `R`
-   determine whether a variable in a dataset is categorical
-   incorporate categorical variables into visualizations of two and three variables
-   obtain summary statistics for each level of a categorical variable

# `r emo::ji("check")` Concept Quiz

**1. Suppose you've run the following code to make side-by-side boxplots of life expectancy:**

    ggplot(data = health, mapping = aes(x = country, y = lifeExp)) + 
        geom_boxplot()

**Your resulting plot looks like this:**

![](images/boxplot_with_overlapping_axis_labels.webp)

**What should you do?**

-   Move country to the y-axis.
-   Remove some countries so the names don't overlap.
-   Nothing, it looks great!

**2. If you didn't want to stack your boxplots side-by-side, how else could you separate the groups?**

::: callout-tip
This does not go inside the aes() function!
:::

**3. What functions are necessary to calculate summary statistics for different groups of a categorical variable?**

-   `summarize()`
-   `mutate()`
-   `arrange()`
-   `group_by()`
-   `filter()`

**4. A categorical variable could be *correctly* stored as what data types?**

-   integer
-   double
-   character
-   factor

**5. In Lab 2, you worked with the `nycflights` dataset, which contained information on flights departing from NYC airports. If we wanted to know the average departure delay for every airline in the dataset (e.g., Delta, Allegiant, United), what steps would we need to use?**

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
First Step

Second Step

Third Step
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
`nycflights`

`group_by(airline)`

`filter(dest == "SFO")`

`summarize(mean_dd = mean(dep_delay))`
:::
:::

**6. What function did you learn that is used for converting a numerical variable to a categorical variable (a process called discretizing)?**

-   `mutate()`
-   `filter()`
-   `if_else()`
-   `group_by()`

**7. The `arrange()` function sorts or reorder a data frame's rows according to the values of the specified variable. By default, what ordering does it use for the rows?**

-   ascending (smallest to largest)
-   descending (largest to smallest)

# Connecting Back to Week 2

**1. In the chapter readings and the tutorials you've learned about different data types. Fill in the associated data types (e.g. character, factor, integer, double) with each type of variable.**

| Variable                      | Data Type in R |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Categorical variable          |                |
| Continuous numerical variable |                |
| Discrete numerical variable   |                |

**2. In the [Language of Data tutorial](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-01-data-01), you were tasked with creating a new *categorical* variable based on a *numerical* variable, a process called "discretizing." You were given the code below:**

```{r tutorial-code}
#| eval: false

# Calculate median number of characters: med_num_char
med_num_char <- median(email50$num_char)

# Create num_char_cat variable in email50
email50_updated <- email50 %>%
  mutate(num_char_cat = if_else(num_char < med_num_char,
                                "[VALUE IF TRUE]",
                                "[VALUE IF FALSE]")
         )
```

Fill in the code with the correct inputs (in place of `[VALUE IF TRUE]` and `[VALUE IF FALSE]`) **and** explain what is happening in each line of the code.
