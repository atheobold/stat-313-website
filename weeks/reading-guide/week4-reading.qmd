# [Modern Dive Chapter 5](https://moderndive.com/5-regression.html)

In Statistics we like to call our $y$ variable the "response" variable. What are some other names $y$ can be called?

</br> </br>

In Statistics we like to call our $x$ variable the "explanatory" variable. What are some other names $x$ can be called?

</br> </br>

What is the difference between "explanatory modeling" and "predictive modeling"?

</br> </br>

In "basic" / simple linear regression, how many explanatory variables are included in the model?

</br> </br>

In linear regression, what type of variable must our response **always** be?

</br> </br>

## 5.1 -- One Numerical Explanatory Variable

### 5.1.1 -- Exploratory data analysis

What is the response variable for the evaluation study? What is the explanatory variable?

</br> </br>

What is "EDA"? Why should you do EDA *before* you analyze your data?

</br> </br>

In the `evals_ch5` dataset, can an instructor appear more than once?

</br> </br>

What statistics does the `skim()` function output?

</br> </br>

What does a *correlation coefficient* measure? Specifically, what type of relationship?

</br> </br>

For correlation coefficients:

-   values near -1 indicate:

-   values near +1 indicate:

-   values near 0 indicate:

</br>

**Quick! -- Which correlation is larger, -0.75 or +0.45?**

</br>

Why did the authors jitter the points in the scatterplot?

</br> </br>

What function adds a regression line to a scatterplot?

</br>

What `method` do you need to specify to get a straight line?

</br>

Based on the scatterplot, how would you describe the relationship between instructor's beauty score and their evaluation score?

</br> </br>

### 5.1.2 -- Simple Linear Regression

In your math class you've seen the equation of a line presented as $y = m \times x + b$. How does this equation change in a statistics class?

-   $m$ becomes:

-   $b$ becomes:

-   $y$ becomes:

-   $x$ becomes:

</br>

What does the hat on top of $y$ represent?

</br> </br>

The intercept ($b_0$) is the value of $\hat{y}$ when $x$ is:

The slope ($b_1$) is the expected change in $\hat{y}$ when $x$ is increased by:

</br>

What function do we use to "fit" a linear regression?

</br>

What function do we use to get the table of regression estimates?

</br>

How do you find the value of the intercept from the regression table?

</br>

How do you find the value of the slope from the regression table?

</br>

### 5.1.3 -- Observed / Fitted Values and Residuals

:::

How do you calculate the *fitted value* of an observation?

</br>

How do you calculate the *residual* of an observation?

</br>

What function can you use to obtain **every** residual for a regression model?

</br>

## 5.2 -- One Categorical Explanatory Variable

### 5.2.1. -- Exploratory Data Analysis

What are the "levels" of the `continent` variable?

</br>

How would you describe the distribution of life expectancy?

</br> </br>

Which continent has the largest variation in life expectancy?

</br>

### 5.2.2 -- Linear Regression

What is an *offset*?

</br> </br>

How does `R` choose what group is the "baseline"?

</br>

When the explanatory variable is categorical the numbers in the regression table associated with each group is the:

</br> </br>

What is an "indicator function"?

</br>

The estimated regression equation for the life expectancy with `continent` as an explanatory variable is:

$$\widehat{\text{life exp}} = 54.8 + 18.8 \cdot 1_{\text{Amer}}(x) + 15.9 \cdot 1_{\text{Asia}}(x) + 22.8 \cdot 1_{\text{Euro}}(x) + 25.9 \cdot 1_{\text{Ocean}}(x)$$

When finding the mean life expectancy for Europe, what value do $1_{\text{Amer}}(x)$, $1_{\text{Asia}}(x)$, and $1_{\text{Ocean}}(x)$ take on?

</br>

For a categorical explanatory variable with $k$ levels, how many offsets will you have?

</br>

### 5.2.3 -- Observed / Fitted Values and Residuals

True or False -- For a linear regression with one categorical explanatory variable, **every** observation associated with the same group (e.g., every country in Asia) will have the **same** fitted value

</br>

## 5.3 -- Related Topics

### 5.3.1. -- Correlation is not necessarily causation

Most people have heard the saying "correlation does not imply causation," but *sometimes* correlation **does** imply causation. What does a study need to have in order for cause and effect statements to be used?

</br> </br>

When this (what you stated above) is not present in a study, you have to worry about *confounding* / *lurking* variables. What is a *confounding* variable?

</br> </br>
